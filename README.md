# Secret Santa Chooser
This is a straightforward program to take a list of people and assign each one a person for whom they will be Secret Santa and sending them an e-mail with their choice.  There is a rudimentary mechanism to prevent certain people from being assigned to each other.

It is written in Ruby.
